- **Interactive Charts**: Hover effects, tooltips, gradient fills
- **Consistent Theming**: Unified color scheme with category-specific colors
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader friendly with proper ARIA labels

## Data Flow

1. **User Interactions**: Users interact with React components that use React Hook Form for input validation
2. **API Calls**: TanStack Query manages API requests with automatic caching and invalidation
3. **Server Processing**: Express routes handle requests, validate data with Zod schemas
4. **Database Operations**: Drizzle ORM performs type-safe database queries
5. **Response Handling**: JSON responses are cached by React Query and trigger UI updates

## External Dependencies

### Core Technologies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: Neon PostgreSQL database driver
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe ORM
- **react-hook-form**: Form management
- **zod**: Runtime type validation

### UI Components
- **@radix-ui/***: Unstyled, accessible UI primitives
- **shadcn/ui**: Pre-built component library
- **tailwindcss**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **recharts**: Chart library for data visualization

### Development Tools
- **vite**: Build tool and dev server
- **tsx**: TypeScript execution for development
- **esbuild**: Production bundling

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. **Frontend Build**: Vite compiles React app to static assets in `dist/public`
2. **Backend Build**: esbuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
3. **Database**: Drizzle migrations ensure schema consistency

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Uses Vite dev server with HMR and Express middleware
- **Production**: Serves static assets from Express with compiled server bundle
- **Database**: PostgreSQL connection via environment variable `DATABASE_URL`

### File Structure
- **`client/`**: Frontend React application
- **`server/`**: Backend Express server
- **`shared/`**: Shared TypeScript types and schemas
- **`migrations/`**: Database migration files

## Technical Highlights

### Chart Implementations
- **Monthly Expenses**: Bar chart with gradient fills and custom formatting
- **Category Pie Chart**: Interactive pie chart with percentage labels and legend
- **Budget Progress**: Progress bars with over-budget warnings
- **Summary Cards**: Financial KPIs with trend indicators

### Data Flow
1. **User Actions**: Forms with React Hook Form validation
2. **API Requests**: TanStack Query with automatic caching and invalidation
3. **Server Processing**: Express routes with Zod validation
4. **Data Storage**: MongoDB-compatible in-memory storage
5. **Real-time Updates**: Automatic UI updates across all components

## Performance Metrics
